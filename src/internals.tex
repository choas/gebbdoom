It took ten months to write this book between October 2017 and July 2018. That was pleasant. Then it took four months to proof-read it from August 2018 to November 2018. That was very unpleasant.\\
\par
I worked on it whenever I could find the time on evenings and weekends, but mostly favoring the 7am to 9am slot. The text was written in \LaTeX{} with Sublime Text 3.0 editor and compiled with \cw{pdflatex}. The \cw{.pdf} can be built with a single command.\\
\par
\tcode{compile.txt}
\par
To improve compilation time, \cw{book.tex} is a simple list of \cw{\textbackslash subfile} commands. Based on which section of the book was being worked on, other lines were commented out. This decreased the build time from several minutes to a few seconds and made \LaTeX{} bearable.\\
\par
 Drawings were made with Inkscape, saved to \cw{.svg} and converted to \cw{.eps} to incorporate nicely with \cw{pdflatex} compiler. Screenshots were cleaned up with Adobe Photoshop CC. The font used is Computer Modern Sans Serif 10pts by Donald E. Knuth.\\
